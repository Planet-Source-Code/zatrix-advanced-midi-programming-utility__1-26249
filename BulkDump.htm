     <H1>SC-55 SysEx Bulk Dump analyse & edit</H1>
     </CENTER>
     <H2>Description</H2>
       <P>I had made a hundred pieces of music, each starting with a
       System Exclusive bulkdump. Recording a bulkdump is a very
       short and easy way, to insure oneself not to loose any of 
       the changed sound canvas parameters. Dis-advantages of working
       with dumps are : they consume memory; take a few bars, so a
       piece of music cannot start at once; other sound modules cannot
       read or receive the information. <BR>
       In my case only a small percentage in the dump are non-default
       values.
       The first purpose of this program is to analyse a bulkdump,
       look for those non-default values, generate alternative
       short messages (= Standard Midi Language) and save them, so
       they can replace the old dump.<BR>
       While launching into the world of midi, I included some more
       features like editing parameters, saving parts, print and
       display dumps, read midi files...</P>
       <P>The drumpatch section of the SC-55 dump isn't addressed by this
       program for now. When you save edited dumps, the values of a previous
       opened dump will be used.</P>
       <P>For now, the program doesn't look very nice. There's nothing fancy
       about it. Only the functionality was important in the current (beta) 
       version. Maybe in the future I'll make a version pleasable to the eyes.
       </P>

     <H2>Menu</H2>

      <H3>File</H3>
        <H4>Midi</H4>
          <P><B>Open</B> - 
          This function reads midi files (*.mid). You can use it to check 
          self-made midi files.
          In this program you can save three kinds of midi files:</P>
            <OL>
              <LI> The edited SC-55 dump</LI>
              <LI> The alternative for the dump</LI>
	      <LI> A fade in/out sequence</LI>
            </OL>
          <P>They all use Standard Midi specification, FormatType 0, 
          Single Track, any channel.</P>
          <P><B>Play</B> - Play a midi file via html-EMBED.</P>

        <H4>Dump</H4>
          <P><B>Open</B> - 
          This function loads a dump into memory. This dump is a single track 
          midi file, recorded with your favorite midi sequencer (Cubase, 
          CakeWalk,...) 
          This is in fact the first thing to do, when your intentions are to edit 
          and save dumps, never bother about alternatives etc. A <I>GSall.mid</I> 
          file is provided containing an initial SC-55 dump with default values.</P>
          <P><B>Save</B> - 
          As discribed above, you should have started by opening a midi dump file, 
          before this function is accessable.</P>
          <P><B>Compare</B> - 
          Compares the content of the current opened dump, with another. The 
          result is a listing of values in the second file, bold, when they are 
          unequal to those in the current opened dump.</P>

        <H4>HTML</H4>
          <P><B>Open</B> - Open any HTML file. Here included for viewing previously
          saved results, namely dump texts.</P>
          <P><B>Save</B> - Save the current HTML content.</P>

        <H4>Part</H4>
          <P><B>Open</B> - Overwrite a current part with the content of a 
          previously saved part.</P>
          <P><B>Save</B> - Save the parameters of one particular part.</P>

        <H4>Exit</H4>
          <P>When you're done, of course (ent meugd nog espe zie)</P>

      <H3>Midi</H3>

        <H4>Devices</H4>
          <P>Here you can choose the desired midi in/out ports. You should choose 
          MPU-401 ports to access the sound canvas.</P>

        <H4>Close all ports</H4>
          <P>The midi-thru, keyboard, mix and micro edit
          functions can open midi ports. If you opened any of them, they will all 
          be closed at once. Many midi drivers and sequencers won't allow you to 
          open ports while they are active. In this case, before you launch your 
          sequencer program, you close all ports here.</P>

        <H4>Midi-Thru</H4>
          <P>Provides access to an extern piano keyboard. You cannot change the 
          channel this piano will play on, within this program. The only way to change 
          the channel, is the hardware one if your piano has this function.</P>

        <H4>Keyboard</H4>
          <P>A software piano keyboard. Here you can play any chosen channel,
          according to the current selected part (Mix & Micro Edit).</P>

        <H4>Mix</H4>
          <P>SC-55 Parts & All Editors<BR>
          If wou want to edit your sound canvas settings directly, check
          the <IMG SRC="midi.gif"> flag. This editor uses and alters the currently opened
          dump values.<BR>
          If you want to make sure that what you see is what you hear:
		<UL>
		  <LI>you have to play an existing dump, 
                  open it in this program and start the editing.</LI>
		  <LI>you have to record a dump containing the current sc55 settings
		  with your sequencer, save it as a single track midi file,
                  open it in this program and start the editing.</LI>
            </UL>
	    </P>
  
        <H4>Fade in/out seq</H4>
        <P>Creates a fade in/out sequence, for selected parts only.</P>

        <H4>Micro edit & save</H4>
          <P>Edit and/or save parameters via System Exclusive Messages 
          (long messages). You can save single SysEx messages in three ways: 
          as a hexadicamal text, a decimal text (*.txt) or the command as 
          it is (*.syx). This last format is known by Cubase, CakeWalk 
          and others.<BR>
          If wou want to edit your sound canvas settings directly, check
          the <IMG SRC="midi.gif"> flag. This editor uses and alters the currently opened
          dump values... .</P>
       
        <H4>GS Reset</H4>
          <P>If a midi out port is open a SysEx command will reset your sound canvas 
          to the default values. If no port is open, only a soft reset (the data in
          our program) will occur.</P>
      
      <H3>Dump</H3>

        <H4>HTML</H4>
          <P>A few HTML text representations of the current dump can be 
          generated here. Behind the scenes a <I>temp.htm</i> file in the
          applications directory will hold the last generated text.</P>
          <P><B>Hex</B> - Shows the contents of the dump in a 
          hexadecimal representation. Non-defaults values are marked.</P>
          <P><B>Dec</B> - Shows the contents of the dump in a 
          decimal or proper representation. Non-defaults values are marked.</P>

        <H4>Print</H4>
          <P>Enables you to print your dump file. 
          Non-defaults values are marked.</P>

        <H4>Alternat</H4>
          <P>Shows or saves alternatives for the current dump content. A GSreset 
          plus all non-default values, only for those parts you use in the piece
          of music, is mostly prefered above the huge actual dump.</P>


     <H2>Questions</H2>
	<P>Direct your questions to the following E-mail address.</P>
	<P><A HREF="mailto:zatrix@load.com">zatrix@load.com</A></P>

	<P>I have my own questions too. One is keeping me from going further
        with this program. It would be nice to find someone who could help.
        The problem is explained on the <A HREF="./SysEx.htm">SysEx.htm</A> page.</P>

        <P>Another question is how to share midi ports between application.
        It's a terrible nuisance when you cannot use 2 midi application at
        the same time. Can this be solved?<BR><BR><BR></P>
